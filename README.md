# ðŸ”¥ Prodigious Tech

This is a fork of Lykrast's [Prodigy Tech](https://github.com/Lykrast/ProdigyTech) which will not receive any updates for 1.12.2 anymore. All credit for this awesome mod goes to them.

Minecraft tech mod inspired by RotaryCraft and IndustrialCraft 2. Machines run on Hot Air instead of traditional RF.
