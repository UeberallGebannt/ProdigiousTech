# ðŸ”¥ Prodigious Tech

Minecraft tech mod inspired by RotaryCraft and IndustrialCraft 2. Machines run on Hot Air instead of traditional RF.

This is a fork of Lykrast's [Prodigy Tech](https://github.com/Lykrast/ProdigyTech) which will not receive any updates for 1.12.2 anymore. All credit for this awesome mod goes to them.

### âœ… What does this fork add/change?
- First of all, Gradle has been updated in order to work with IntelliJ.
- It is now possible to change what blocks the Magmatic Aeroheater can use as a heat source. You can add new blocks by adding them to the oredict entry `listGeneratesHeat` (for example using [CraftTweaker](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/crafttweaker)).
- German translation (TODO)
